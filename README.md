Country service is an application that allows looking up basic information about the different countries of the world and displaying it in a minimalistic and intuitive UI.

The service utilizes a Java Spring backend that gets data from a third party API, and a Next.js frontend to display the data and make queries.

Build steps:
1. Clone the Github repo
2. Install the Maven dependencies
3. Run the main method in CountryserviceApplication.java, this will start the application by default on http://localhost:8080
4. Run ```cd countryservice-frontend```
5. Run ```npm install```
6. Run ```npm run dev```, the frontend interface will start on ```http://localhost:3000
